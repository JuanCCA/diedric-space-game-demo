# Spaceship Game

## Overview
This project is a simple game featuring a dihedral view where a small spaceship can be moved using the W, A, S, and D keys. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Project Structure
- `src/index.html`: The main HTML document that sets up the structure of the game, including the canvas elements for the dihedral view and links to the CSS and JavaScript files.
- `src/css/style.css`: Contains the styles for the game, including layout, colors, and visual elements needed for the game interface.
- `src/js/game.js`: The main JavaScript file that initializes the game, handles the game loop, and manages the rendering of the spaceship and the dihedral view.
- `src/js/ship.js`: Defines the `Ship` class, which includes properties for the spaceship's position and methods for updating its position based on user input.
- `src/js/controls.js`: Manages the keyboard controls for moving the spaceship using the W, A, S, and D keys.
- `assets/audio/.gitkeep`: A placeholder to ensure that the audio directory is tracked in version control.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open `src/index.html` in your web browser to start the game.
3. Use the W, A, S, and D keys to control the spaceship.
